    Angular unit tests are a fundamental aspect of software development with Angular. They allow developers to verify the correctness of individual units of code, such as components, services, and directives, in isolation from the rest of the application. By writing unit tests, developers can ensure that each piece of code behaves as expected, catching bugs early in the development process and facilitating easier refactoring and maintenance. Angular unit tests are typically written using testing frameworks like Jasmine and testing utilities provided by the Angular framework itself, such as TestBed and ComponentFixture. These tests involve mocking dependencies, simulating component interactions, and asserting expected behavior, providing confidence in the stability and reliability of Angular applications.</p>
